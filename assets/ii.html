<p>Scala map Function
The map function in Scala is used to transform each element in a collection and return a new collection with the transformed values. It’s a fundamental concept in functional programming.

Why Use map?
Transformation: Applies a function to every element in a collection.
Immutable Operations: It does not modify the original collection but returns a new one.
Eliminates Loops: Reduces the need for for loops, making code cleaner and more readable.
Works with Parallel Processing: Useful in distributed computing frameworks like Apache Spark.

<h4>Scala filter Function</h4>
The filter function in Scala is used to select elements from a collection that satisfy a given condition. It is useful when you need to remove unwanted data and keep only relevant items.

<b>Why Use filter?</b>

Data Cleaning: Removes unwanted or invalid data.
Improved Efficiency: Processes only necessary data.
Eliminates Loops: Avoids traditional for loops, making the code cleaner.
Useful in Big Data Processing: Widely used in Apache Spark to filter large datasets.
Use Case: Filtering Orders Based on Status
Scenario
You are working with an e-commerce system that stores customer orders. Each order has:

Order ID (Int)
Customer Name (String)
Order Status (String): Could be "Shipped", "Processing", or "Cancelled".
Your task: Extract only the "Shipped" orders

<h4>Scala flatMap Function</h4>
The flatMap function is a combination of map and flatten. It applies a function to each element in a collection, which itself returns a collection, and then flattens the result into a single list.

Why Use flatMap?
✅ Removes Nested Structures: Flattens lists of lists into a single list.
✅ Useful for Data Transformation: Helps break down complex data.
✅ Common in Spark: Used in distributed data processing (RDD transformations).

Use Case: Tokenizing Sentences into Words
Scenario
You are building a text processing system where you have a list of sentences, and you need to extract all the words individually.
