Scala flatMap Function
The flatMap function is a combination of map and flatten. It applies a function to each element in a collection, which itself returns a collection, and then flattens the result into a single list.

Why Use flatMap?
✅ Removes Nested Structures: Flattens lists of lists into a single list.
✅ Useful for Data Transformation: Helps break down complex data.
✅ Common in Spark: Used in distributed data processing (RDD transformations).
